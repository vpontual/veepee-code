 *
 *  Length alone was not enough. "what is pinky" earned a correct 400-character
 *  answer needing no tools, tripped the length test, got nudged, and the model
 *  — having already answered — invented work: it read three unrelated files out
 *  of the current directory and summarised them. A good answer to a question is
 *  long, so length is a proxy for "substantive", not for "a task went undone".
 *
 *  So a lookup request that produced no stated intent to act is now left alone.
 *  Both conditions are required to suppress: "why is this test failing" is a
 *  lookup in form, but if the model answers it with "let me check the logs" and
 *  no tool call, that is exactly the stall worth nudging.
 *
 *  The length floor USED to run first, and that made it the real gate: nothing
 *  shorter than 200 characters could ever be nudged, whatever it said. The 35B's
 *  failure mode moved — it stopped narrating to the token cap and started stalling
 *  in one line. The Nightly Engineer's five barren nights (2026-08-03..07) are
 *  literally these stored job results: "Let me explore the project first." (33 B)
 *  and "Let me explore the project first to find a real issue to fix." (61 B), each
 *  a ~2s run with zero tool calls and a byte-identical workspace. Both are pure
 *  STATED_INTENT — the exact signal this function already computes — and both were
 *  thrown away by a length test applied before anyone looked at them.
 *
 *  So intent leads and length is the fallback. A promise to act, or a user who
 *  plainly asked for work, is a stall at ANY length (including an empty reply,
 *  which is a stall by definition). Length only decides the residual case where
 *  neither side mentioned work at all — a plain conversational exchange — which is
